# Vizsla Diary

The inspiration for the name comes for a search for dog breeds that retrieve,
trying to find a name that would stand alone, as opposed to a rambling name such
as German Wirehaired Pointer. Weimaraner and Stabyhoun where appealing names,
and dogs, but [Vizsla](http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/vizsla) is shorter and
easier to type. Hard to find Stabyhoun artwork because they are so rare.
